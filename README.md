# House-Price-Prediction-using-ML-models
This project explores house price prediction using various machine learning regression models to determine the most effective approach. The dataset undergoes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation to ensure accurate predictions.

Linear Regression – Baseline model for performance comparison.
Lasso Regression – Feature selection with L1 regularization.
Ridge Regression – Handles multicollinearity using L2 regularization.
Decision Tree Regressor – Captures nonlinear relationships.
Random Forest Regressor – Reduces overfitting with ensemble learning.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regressor – Predicts based on similar data points.
XGBoost Regressor – Gradient boosting for high accuracy.
AdaBoost Regressor – Boosting technique for reducing bias.
CatBoost Regressor – Efficient handling of categorical data.
